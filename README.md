Experiment 3

Aim - To study and implement Operators in C++.

Apparatus - VS Code or Programiz online C++ compiler.

Theory - 

Program 1:
This C++ program checks whether two numbers, x and y, entered by the user are positive or negative. It first asks the user to input values for x and y. Then, using if-else statements, it checks each number: if the
number is greater than 0, it prints that it is positive; otherwise, it prints that it is negative. This program helps in understanding how to take input and use conditions to check the sign of numbers.

Program 2:
This C++ program is used to calculate a student's grade based on the marks they enter out of 100. It starts by asking the user to input their marks and stores that value in the variable marks. Then, it uses a
series of if-else-if conditions to compare the entered marks with different ranges. If the marks are between 90 and 100, the program prints "Your grade is A+." If the marks fall between 80 and 89, it prints "Your
grade is A," and so on for grades B, C, and D. If the marks are below 50, the program prints "You failed." This program helps understand how decision-making (conditional statements) works in C++. It shows how we
can use conditions to check specific ranges and give different outputs based on the user's input.

Program 3:
This C++ program is used to determine the quadrant in which a point lies on the Cartesian coordinate system based on the values of x and y entered by the user. It first asks the user to input values for x 
(horizontal axis) and y (vertical axis). Then, using if-else conditions, the program checks the sign (positive or negative) of both x and y to identify the correct quadrant:
1. If both x and y are positive, the point lies in the 1st Quadrant.
2. If x is negative and y is positive, it's in the 2nd Quadrant.
3. If both x and y are negative, it's in the 3rd Quadrant.
4. If x is positive and y is negative, it's in the 4th Quadrant.

Conclusion - I used Logical Operators and Relational Operators in the above 3 codes and also used conditional statements (if-else) to execute the codes and get the desired outputs.
